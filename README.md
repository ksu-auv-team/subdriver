# Main high-level objective executer for 2018

Now in Python! Start with execute.py.

TODO: add in environment setup suggestions; where to get/install rospy for local development, and other library deps. maybe even an env setup script (in a containerized python env, for consistency in dev experience).

## Install
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev
sudo pip2 install -U pymavlink
```
